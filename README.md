# super-michael-ball
Junior year Francis Tuttle Game Dev class project about a little boy named Michael. He loooooves food!

This game functions like Super Monkey Ball. You roll around as a fat guy looking for his lost cat.
There are a variety of floating levels that you run through where you reach a fridge at the end.
